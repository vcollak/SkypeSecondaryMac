SkypeSecondaryMac
=================

Ability to run secondary Skype on a Mac. By defaut Skype does not allow the user to turn the app twice. 
To overcome that simply exceute skype as sudo: sudo /Applications/Skype.app/Contents/MacOS/Skype &.

This project packages that shell command into an app you can simply drop into your /Applications folder on the Mac. 
This will allow you to run a secondary copy of Skype from your Applications folder or drop it into a Dock.
